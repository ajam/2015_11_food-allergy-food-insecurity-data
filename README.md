### What's here?
The `food-alternatives-list` files (same data in `csv` and `json` formats) contain the names and prices of products used in the interactive features.

### Methodology for choosing products

Products and prices were selected on the basis of availability and price at the Hy-Vee where Lisa Neri, the main subject of the story, normally shops. Store and local brand products were excluded. Manufacturer prices online were used if no alternative was available at Hy-Vee. Alternative food prices are for the cheapest alternative product that does not include a selected allergen. 

In cases where alternatives products were sold in different sizes, the closest size was used (e.g., the cheapest bread was sold in 16 to 24 ounce sizes, and bread alternatives were chosen within that range) or an adjusted cost was used (e.g., alternative cheese prices, which are sold in 7 to 8 ounce sizes, were adjusted to 12 ounces).
